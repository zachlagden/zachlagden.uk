## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Consistent color mapping pattern across all components | 01-03 | Ensures predictable dark mode behavior: neutral-800→#e5e5e5, neutral-600→neutral-400, etc. |
| Skill badges use 950-level dark colors | 01-03 | Maintains color identity while ensuring proper contrast against #0a0a0a background |
| Shadow to glow replacement in dark mode | 01-03 | Shadows don't work on dark backgrounds; subtle white glow provides depth |
| Form inputs use #1a1a1a background | 01-03 | Elevated surface color distinguishes interactive elements from page background |
| shadcn/ui New York style with Neutral base | 01-01 | Cleaner aesthetic, good foundation for custom dark colors |
| defaultTheme="system" with enableSystem | 01-01 | Respects OS preference on first visit, auto-syncs with system changes |
| Dark colors: #0a0a0a bg, #e5e5e5 text | 01-01 | Reduces eye strain vs pure black/white, modern aesthetic |
| 150ms theme transitions with reduced motion support | 01-01 | Smooth UX for most users, instant for accessibility |
| MongoDB for blog storage | project | User preference |
| GitHub OAuth for authentication | project | Developer-focused audience |
